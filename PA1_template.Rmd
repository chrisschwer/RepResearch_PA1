# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

First we need to unzip the file *"activity.zip"*, then we can read it into a data frame *df*.

```{r}
unzip ("activity.zip")
df <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

Looking at the summary and the first few lines of the data, we see that the format need not be changed for the analyses below.

```{r}
summary (df)
head(df)
```

Each observation has a row, with the date in column *date*, the interval in column *interval* and the number of steps in the first column *steps*. The position is unconventional, but will not hinder our analysis.

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Using the *data.table* package, so in case it is not pre-installed, installing it.

```{r}
install.packackages("data.table")
library(data.table)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
